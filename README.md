GokiStats is a skill improvement mod for Minecraft, it has been well-known before 1.7.10 but it has stopped developing for years.

Feel free to solve any issue with crash-report in GitHub Issues.

Forum thread on [Mcbbs](http://www.mcbbs.net/thread-805910-1-1.html)

## Why you still port it to recent versions?

Umm... Because lots of players have used to type 'Y' to open the skill menu and drain their experiences.

Also, the interface provides is pretty and easy-to-use.
